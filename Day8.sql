### Practice Questions:
-- 1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
select *, upper(name) as uppercase_name from patients;
-- 2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
select *, length(staff_name) as length_of_staff_name from staff;

-- 3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
select concat(staff_id, '-', staff_name) from staff;

/* ### Daily Challenge:
**Question:** Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, 
service in lowercase, age category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'),
and name length. Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.*/

select
	patient_id,
    upper(name) as full_name,
    lower(service) as service,
    case when age >=65 then 'senior'
         when age >=18 then 'adult'
         else 'Minor' end as age_category,
	length(name) as name_length
from patients
where length(name) > 10;
