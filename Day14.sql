### Practice Questions:
-- 1. Show all staff members and their schedule information (including those with no schedule entries).
select 
	s.*,
    ss.week,
    ss.present
from staff s left join staff_schedule ss on s.staff_id = ss.staff_id;

-- 2. List all services from services_weekly and their corresponding staff (show services even if no staff assigned).
select
	*
from services_weekly sw
left join staff s on sw.service = s.service;

-- 3. Display all patients and their service's weekly statistics (if available).
select
	*
from patients p left join services_weekly sw on p.service = sw.service;


/* ### Daily Challenge:
**Question:** Create a staff utilisation report showing all staff members (staff_id, staff_name, role, service)
and the count of weeks they were present (from staff_schedule).
Include staff members even if they have no schedule records. Order by weeks present descending.*/

select
	s.staff_id,
    s.staff_name,
    s.role,
    s.service,
    count(case when ss.present = 1 then 1 end) as weeks_present
from staff s 
left join staff_schedule ss 
	on s.staff_id = ss.staff_id
group by 
	s.staff_id,
    s.staff_name,
    s.role,
    s.service
order by weeks_present desc;
